## Bug reporting and contributing

Everything you need to know about bug reporting and contributing [is located here](https://github.com/owncloud/gallery/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Preparation
Here is a list of steps you might want to take before using the app

### Supporting more media types
First, make sure you have installed ImageMagick and its imagick PECL extension.
Next add a few new entries to your **config/config.php** configuration file.

```
  'preview_max_scale_factor' => 1,
  'enabledPreviewProviders' =>
  array (
    0 => 'OC\\Preview\\PNG',
    1 => 'OC\\Preview\\JPEG',
    2 => 'OC\\Preview\\GIF',
    11 => 'OC\\Preview\\Illustrator',
    12 => 'OC\\Preview\\Postscript',
    13 => 'OC\\Preview\\Photoshop',
    14 => 'OC\\Preview\\TIFF'
  ),
```

Look at the sample configuration (config.sample.php) in your config folder if you need more information about how the config file works.
That's it. You should be able to see more media types in your slideshows and galleries as soon as you've installed the app.

### Improving performance

#### Redis for files locking

Using Redis for files locking improves performance **by a factor of 10** when loading an album.

Read about it in the [ownCloud](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/configuration_files/files_locking_transactional.html) Administration Manual

#### Assets pipelining
Make sure to enable "asset pipelining", so that all the Javascript and CSS resources can be mixed together.
This can greatly reduce the loading time of the app.

Read about it in the [ownCloud](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/configuration_server/js_css_asset_management_configuration.html) Administration Manual

## Installation

### Installing from the app store

* As an admin, select "Apps" in the menu
* Go to the "disabled apps" section
* Enable Gallery

### Installing from archive

* Go to the [the releases page](https://github.com/owncloud/gallery/releases)
* Download the latest release/archive to your server's **apps/** directory
* Unpack the app
* **IMPORTANT**: Make sure the folder name is gallery

### Installing from Git

In your terminal go into the **apps/** directory and then run the following command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/owncloud/gallery.git
```

Now you can activate it in the apps menu. It's called Gallery

To update the app go inside you *apps/gallery/** directory and type:
```
$ git pull --rebase
```

### Uninstalling

#### Redirect gallery link shares

When disabling or uninstalling the app, all link shares created with the app will stop working.
Instead of having to resend new links to all recipients, you can setup a redirection on the server to redirect gallery-style links to regular public links. This means that people with the original link will get redirected to the regular file view instead of getting a 404 page.

For this, edit your `.htaccess` file in the ownCloud root folder and add a new rewrite rule among the existing ones or with a new block at the bottom of the file:

```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine on  
  RewriteRule ^/apps/gallery/s/(.*)$ /s/$1 [L,R=301]
</IfModule>
```
